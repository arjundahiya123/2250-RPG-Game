## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Unity Setup

Before you can run `2Serious`, you need to set up Unity on your computer. If you haven't already, download and install Unity Hub from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/download). After installing Unity Hub, you'll need to install a compatible version of the Unity Editor (e.g., Unity 2020.3.14f1). You can do this through Unity Hub by navigating to the Installs tab and clicking the "Add" button to add a new version of the Unity Editor.

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Install GitHub Desktop**: Simplify the process of working with Git repositories by installing GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Open GitHub Desktop and select `File` > `Clone Repository`. Go to the `URL` tab and paste `https://github.com/pushpinderSekhon10/2Serious.git`.
3. **Choose a Local Path**: Specify a local path where you want the repository to be cloned and click `Clone`.
4. **Fetching from Main Branch**: Ensure you're working with the latest version of the code by fetching the changes from the main branch. In GitHub Desktop, select `Repository` from the menu, then `Fetch origin`. If updates are available, click `Pull` to update your local repository.

## How the Game Works

`2Serious` is an action-packed game where you traverse through three distinct levels, battling zombie enemies to reclaim the land. Here's how to get started:

1. **Starting the Game**: Upon launching `2Serious`, you'll immediately jump into the game without encountering a main menu. Your objective is to defeat the enemies presented at each level. The enemies will progressively become more challenging as you advance through the map.

2. **Game Controls**:
   - Movement: Utilize the AWSD keys or arrow keys to move forward, backward, left, and right.
   - Combat: Press 'E' to use your sword and 'F' to defend against attacks.
   - Marketplace Access: To access the marketplace, click the 'Enter/Return' button on your keyboard. Here, you'll be prompted with two options: to either increase your health (press 1) or boost your damage (press 2). You can collect coins scattered across the map to redeem these benefits.

3. **Respawn Mechanism**: If you perish during the game, you can respawn by pressing 'R' and return to the spot where you began.

4. **Collectibles and Upgrades**: Keep an eye out for coins scattered across the map. These coins can be redeemed at the marketplace for beneficial upgrades, enhancing your chances of survival against the relentless undead horde.

`2Serious` offers an immersive gaming experience filled with adrenaline-pumping action and strategic decision-making. Will you rise to the challenge and reclaim the kingdom, or will darkness prevail? The fate of 2Serious lies in your hands.
