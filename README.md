## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Unity Setup

Before you can run `2Serious`, you need to set up Unity on your computer. If you haven't already, download and install Unity Hub from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/download). After installing Unity Hub, you'll need to install a Unity Editor version that is compatible with this project (e.g., Unity 2020.3.14f1). You can do this through Unity Hub by navigating to the Installs tab and clicking the "Add" button to add a new version of the Unity Editor.

### Pulling the Code

1. **Install GitHub Desktop**: To simplify the process of working with Git repositories, install GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Open GitHub Desktop and select `File` > `Clone Repository`. Go to the `URL` tab and paste `https://github.com/pushpinderSekhon10/2Serious.git`.
3. **Choose a Local Path**: Specify a local path where you want the repository to be cloned and click `Clone`.
4. **Fetching from Main Branch**: To ensure you're working with the latest version of the code, fetch the changes from the main branch. In GitHub Desktop, select `Repository` from the menu, then `Fetch origin`. If there are updates, click `Pull` to update your local repository.

## How the Game Works

`2Serious` is an action-packed game where you traverse through three distinct levels, battling zombie enemies to reclaim the land. Here's how to get started:

1. **Starting the Game**: After launching `2Serious`, you will jump straight into the game without encountering a main menu. You'll have to delete the enemies presented at each level. The enemies will get increasingly more difficult as you travel up the map.
   
2. **Game Controls**:
   - Movement: Use the AWSD keys or arrow keys to move forward, backward, left, and right.
   - Combat: Press 'E' to use your sword and 'F' to defend against attacks.
   - Marketplace Access: Click the 'Enter/Return' button on your computer to access the marketplace. Here, you will be prompted with two options: to either have a health increase (press 1) or to have a damage increase (press 2). You can collect coins to redeem these benefits all across the map.

3. **Respawn Mechanism**: If you die during the game, you can respawn by clicking 'R' and you will return to the spot you started.

4. **Collectibles and Upgrades**: Keep an eye out for scattered coins across the map. These coins can be redeemed at the marketplace for beneficial upgrades, enhancing your chances of survival against the relentless undead horde.

`2Serious` offers an immersive gaming experience filled with adrenaline-pumping action and strategic decision-making. Will you rise to the challenge and reclaim the kingdom, or will the darkness prevail? The fate of 2Serious lies in your hands.
